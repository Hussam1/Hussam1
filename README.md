### Hi, Iâ€™m Hussam ðŸ‘‹, a Data Scientist (forever learning ðŸ¤“)

In my daily tasks, I provide internal data science consultancy, hence projects performed are diverse and serve different purposes:

Some examples of projects performed:
- **Unsupervised learning Outlier detection** data comes from procurment department 
- **Detailed EDA** combined with statical A/B testing (multiple projects)
- **Process Mining on AML process (Anti money laundry)** using it to highlight not compliant portion of the process ðŸ™„ 
- **Network analysis** to decode a very complex project management structure, explaining the interactions of project members in cross brands projects. Used later to identify bottlenecks and updates project's layouts
- **Vehicle Sales value forecast**, tested many models however model deployed eventually was XGBoost
- **Document similarity NLP** using DeepLearning Neural Network to classify and cluster massive amount of documents. eventually utilized by Auditing department saving them from going through all these documents manually ðŸ˜…

I love good Visualization because: they're fun! ðŸ˜„

ðŸŒ± Interested in developing my knowledge in NLP and Reinforcement learning
